/*
 * Problem Statement:
 * Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
 * 
 * Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
 * After each pass, the largest element in the unsorted part of the array moves to its correct position.
 * 
 * Example Input:
 * arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22}
 * Output:
 * arr = {12, 22, 25, 34, 64} 
 */

/*
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n) when the array is already sorted (no swaps needed).
 * - Worst Case: O(n^2) when the array is sorted in reverse order.
 * - Average Case: O(n^2) for random order of elements.
 * 
 * Space Complexity:
 *  O(1), as the sorting is done in place without any extra memory.

 * Dry Run:

 *
 * Pass 1:

 * - Compare 64 and 25 → Swap → arr = {34, 25, 64, 12, 22}
 * - Compare 64 and 12 → Swap → arr = {34, 25, 12, 64, 22}
 * - Compare 64 and 22 → Swap → arr = {34, 25, 12, 22, 64}
 *
 * Pass 2:
 * - Compare 34 and 25 → Swap → arr = {25, 34, 12, 22, 64}
 * - Compare 34 and 12 → Swap → arr = {25, 12, 34, 22, 64}
 * - Compare 34 and 22 → Swap → arr = {25, 12, 22, 34, 64}
 *
 * Pass 3:
 * - Compare 25 and 12 → Swap → arr = {12, 25, 22, 34, 64}
 * - Compare 25 and 22 → Swap → arr = {12, 22, 25, 34, 64}
 *
 * Pass 4:
 * - Compare 12 and 22 → No Swap → arr = {12, 22, 25, 34, 64}
 *
 * Final Output: arr = {12, 22, 25, 34, 64}
