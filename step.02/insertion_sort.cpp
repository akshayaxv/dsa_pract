/*
 * Problem Statement:
 * Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
 * 
 * Insertion Sort works by dividing the array into a sorted and unsorted part. It picks each element
 * from the unsorted part and places it in the correct position in the sorted part.
 * 
 * Example Input:
 * arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22}
 * Output:
 * arr = {12, 22, 25, 34, 64}
 */

/*
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
 * - Worst Case: O(n^2) when the array is sorted in reverse order.
 * - Average Case: O(n^2) for random order of elements.
 * 
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1), as the sorting is done in place without extra memory.
